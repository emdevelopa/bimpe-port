                    <strong>The Forgotten Kingdom</strong> is a powerful epic story of people striving for identity,
                    struggle of
                    civilizations and interplay of modernization and traditionalism. Intriguingly combining a
                    love story, it also inquires on whether love and tolerance can defeat havoc and if love can
                    restore what war left behind.
